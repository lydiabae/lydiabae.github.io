						<h4>Serko | Concierge Mobile Application</h4>
							<p>Serko Limited is an Asia-Pacific based company that provides travel solutions and services to leading travel companies. Recognising the significance of an upwards trend in the mobile internet traffic, Serko’s founders approached Terabyte to leverage their mobile strategy. Although they had a working prototype, they need to make the application more in light with their branding and more user friendly. </p>
							<h2>Requirements </h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Following existing application framework and adopting Serko’s branding into a mobile format.</li>
								<li>Designing templates for different mobile screen sizes </li>
								<li>Understanding user interaction with application and applying our learnings from user testing on wireframes</li>
								<li>Suggesting new ideas to client based on existing working prototype</li>

						<h4>The Mood Board</h4>
						<p>This app was specifically targeted to business travellers. To make the app more interesting and unique based on the brand, I started brainstorming ideas around the 'Business Trips'. On startup, the app presents you with a simple set of icons and business-related travel objects familiar to business travellers. This makes the app easy to use and resonates the spirit of the Serko brand. The app allows users to personalise their experience by give them the ability to create customised wallpapers and colour palettes.</p>

						<h4>Ideation</h4>
							<p>I applied my strengths in user-centric design, audience analysis, and mobile strategy to prototype a mobile application for business travellers codenamed Concierge. Serko felt that a mobile strategy would increase engagement from their customers. From a design perspective, a higher degree of personality was required to make the app feel more personable, likeable and emotive. The resulting product was a premier corporate travelling tool that managed your itinerary, accommodation, and transport giving its users piece of mind.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Loading Screen</strong> - To create a simple loading screen I designed an airplane icon that moves from bottom of phone screen and takes off to top of the screen. The runway turns itself into a business suit background.</li>
								<li><strong>Homepage</strong> - Provide quick access to pages. Using iconography to increase readability.</li>
								<li><strong>Upcoming Trips</strong> - ‘Upcoming Trips’ panel needed to be more prominent than other components on the page. Using different colour and texture and reminder icon helps user to focus on their next trip.</li>
								<li><strong>Trips</strong> - To contain a larger amount of content on one page, I decided to display the name of the trip, date, location and number of trip </li>
								<li><strong>Trips Detail</strong> - able to scan the content quickly and browse to previous & next itinerary. </li>
							</ul>

						<h4>The Result</h4>
						<p>The final product mixed beautiful design with a functional application that truly serves a Serko’s customer. The client was very happy not only with the features and the design, but the level of precision the application offered. Serko are excitedly continuing development on the application. They have showcased the prototype work to date to key clients including Microsoft and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. This application design supported theming to enable instances to be branded with corporate client logos and identity. In targeting a corporate market, the design leveraged the best of classic and contemporary within the business world.</p>
