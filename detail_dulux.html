							<h4>Dulux Digital Brand Guidelines</h4>
								<div class="col-sm-9">
						<p>The main objective of this project is creating a new digital brand guideline for Dulux to help to guide and produce design that can adapt to different devices and environments. Also we were challenged to consolidate and develop the existing websites, applications and in-store apps. Our goal was creating a new brand guideline that is easy, flexible and expandable for users, designers and developers while we maintaining the brand personality. The big challenge was consolidating digital brand guideline. It was a little fractured because they were working with agencies around the world. </p>

						<h4>Taking a digital first approach to brand development</h4>
						<p>The brand is just more than a logo. In this digital era, brand must adapt different ways of approaching users and represent their personality. With increasing numbers of mobile user and wearables, brand must think an integrated brand experience in different digital environment. Digital platforms allow a brand to interact with users in new ways. a user experience is an extension of a brand’s personality. It’s becoming more sophisticated with motion and animation to create unique brand experiences that provide clarity and personality.</p>
						<p>This project allowed me to explore interesting new ways of designing digital brand guideline. Some good examples of style guides include Google’s material design, BBC Gel, Mozilla, IBM, SalesForce among many others that are available online. I was working with a UX designer, design director and digital strategist. </p>

					<h4>Why digital branding is important</h4>
					<p>Brand design is exciting and challenging at same time. Many brand marks are designed for physical spaces or printing. Most of brand designers focus on positive/negative spaces, forms and colour when they design logos rather than the digital space. Therefore a lot of digital designers are challenged and tested while they try to bring existing brand marks or logos into the digital spaces. Whether we are graphic designers, digital designers or typographers, we should really consider when we design our logos than can adapt and transform in different environment. </p>

 					<h4>Brandmark</h4>
 					<p>Dulux’s is the brand that has been loved by many many people since 1918. The logo itself, it’s easily recognisable by customers and we doubt that it will change in few years. The good news is we challenged ourselves to suggest a new way of displaying the existing logo on different devices. Here is a good example: <a href = "http://www.responsivelogos.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.responsivelogos.co.uk </a></p>

					<p class="description-right">Proposed a fluid grid system that breaks into three main sizes - small, medium and large. With a maximum width of 1400px and a minimum width of 320px. Within these break points, content should respond to fit the view port, by scaling larger or smaller. </p>
					<p class="description-right">We employed an 8 pixel baseline grid system to help with the vertical alignment of page components. Scaling down or up in 8px or 8dp grid results in shapes cleanly aligned to pixel boundaries. Therefore you will get crisper assets without making any other changes.</p>

					<h4>Typography</h4>
					<p>Choosing a typography is a big task. It can change the look and feel or the brand very easily. I focus on three requirements when I choose a typeface: readability, accessibility and personality. Not every font is readable. It need to be tested on the browsers and different devices in different sizes, weight and colour. Online fonts should be accessible for all users. I recommend using free font recources and fonts with smaller file size. Showing a personality is more than choosing a font between serif and sans serif. Searching history and usages of a font can be also helpful. </p>

					<h4>Iconography</h4>
					<p>The existing icon style wasn’t designed for digital environment. The icons weren’t scalable for high resolution screens and expandable to create new icons based on existing sets. My goal was creating a set of icons that work on all devices and sizes. Every icon has different meanings and purpose, we looked at two icon types: Product icons and system icons.</p>
					<p>Product icons are designed to express the brand personality and represent services. System icons or UI icons are used to represent common actions like menu, print and save. </p>
					<p>Our aim is designing unique, simple, modern and friendly icons style for Dulux. I recommend using icons if it’s only 100% clear to everyone. When in doubt, kip the icon. Stick to simple copy or use a label. Also I often looked at https://thenounproject.com/</p>

Icons accommodate for limited space, but are sized for interactive, touch-friendly experiences. They can indicate change, provide visual cues for the eye and increase recognition. The clarity of function should remain the same in each executions, accept the level of detail can increase or decrease.</p>

A touch target that’s 45 – 57 pixels wide allows the user’s finger to fit snugly inside the target. The edges of the target are visible when the user taps it. This provides them with clear visual feedback that they’re hitting the target accurately.</p>

					<h4>Motion</h4>
					<p>Skype is a good example of showing brand personality in motion. Skype’s launching animation and other interaction clearly show excitement, fun and engaging personalities.

We come to a conclusion that the elegant motion works well with simple elements such as buttons, navigation and search. The animation should be simple and intuitive for users when they interact with these elements. When liquefied motion shows more fun and engaging personality, the animation could be used on transitions, loading screen and siwpe gestures.</p>

For designers, everything will be easy to search without clicking hungers of pages and downloading brand assets. For developers, they can download and reuse consistent assets without creating something new. The future of brand guideline is right around the corner, and I’m expecting designers and developers lives will get much, much easier. </p>
